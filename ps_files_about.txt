ps_fig2_equate.py - equates players on first one/two scores. Also allows you to calculate maximum score on Nth play rather than on any (unspecified) play

ps_fig2_rebaseline.py - normalises plots to an initial score of zero

ps_fig2_score.py - compares learning curves for aggregate score vs average score (rather than attempt number vs average score)

ps_tracegap.py - compares those with and without a minimum 6 hour gap in their plays

ps_tracegap2.py - as ps_tracegap.py but uses a smaller set, so we can equate the gap/nogap groups on their first scores

ps_machinechurn - shows that for plays with a high number of attempts the lerning curve regularity doesn't hold
